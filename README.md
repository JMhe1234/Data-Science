Developed an anime recommendation system using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

Cleaned and preprocessed anime data, handling missing values, duplicates, and categorical inconsistencies.

Performed data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib to analyze top-rated animes by category (TV, Web, Movie, OVA).

Implemented TF-IDF vectorization to extract meaningful features from anime descriptions.

Computed cosine similarity, using liner kernel to identify and recommend similar anime titles.

Built a content-based filtering recommendation system that suggests top 10 animes based on user input.

Improved user experience by ensuring efficient similarity computation for large datasets.
